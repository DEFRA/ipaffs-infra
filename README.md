## Next Generation Infrastructure-as-Code for IPAFFS

Please note this project is still a proof-of-concept. We are currently aiming to:

- provide a smooth working development environment based on Kubernetes
- validate our new architecture as quickly as possible by investigating unknowns and looking for unknown unknowns
- set up pipeline-driven infrastructure-as-code using Bicep
- port IPAFFS to new container infrastructure

Currently we are focused on establishing a local development environment using [K3S](https://k3s.io/), so that we can
validate our plans and assumptions, port IPAFFS to Kubernetes, and overhaul the development experience.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:DEFRA/ipaffs-infra
   ```

2. Install the following prerequisite software:
    - [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima)
    - [Kubernetes command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)
    - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
    - [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16)

   This can be achieved on macOS with the following:

   ```shell
   brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
   brew update
   HOMEBREW_ACCEPT_EULA=Y brew install microsoft/mssql-release/msodbcsql17 microsoft/mssql-release/mssql-tools
   brew install lima kubectl docker docker-buildx
   ```
   
3. Ensure you have the `docker-local` repository cloned and have checked out the `feature/support-sourcing-scripts` branch. This
   requires access to the private repository on GitLab and is a temporary requirement we expect to eliminate in the near future.

   ```shell
   mkdir -p ~/git/imports && cd ~/git/imports
   git clone git@giteux.azure.defra.cloud:imports/docker-local
   cd docker-local
   git checkout feature/support-sourcing-scripts
   ```

4. Set the `DEFRA_WORKSPACE` environment variable to the parent directory of your `docker-local` clone.

   ```shell
   export DEFRA_WORKSPACE="${HOME}/git/imports"
   ```
   
5. Run the Lima/K3S setup script.

   ```shell
   cd ~/git/ipaffs-infra
   scripts/lima-k3s.sh
   ```
   
6. Follow the printed instructions to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and configure a Docker context.

   ```shell
   export KUBECONFIG="${HOME}/.lima/ipaffs/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml"
   docker context create lima-ipaffs --docker "host=unix://${HOME}/.lima/ipaffs/sock/docker.sock"
   docker context use lima-ipaffs
   ```
   
7. Run the database setup script to build, push and run the SQL Server container, and populate the databases.

   ```shell
   scripts/setup-database.sh
   ```

   Note that the first time the newly built container is started, it may take a few minutes for SQL Server to begin accepting 
   connections, and the subsequent migration may fail. If this happens, you can re-run the above script and it should begin
   the migrations and data load. Once the data load has started, you can no longer safely re-run this script and you will need
   to delete all databases (or the database server) and start again. To delete the entire SQL Server instance:

   ```shell
   kubectl delete statefulset database
   kubectl delete pvc database-data
   ```
   
8. Once the database has been initialized and populated, you are ready to begin building and deploying services!
